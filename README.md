# Selection Word Count

This simple VSCode extension calculates the word count of a selection and displays it in the status bar. The status bar item is hidden when nothing is selected (the selection word count is zero).

## Requirements

This is an adaptation of the [word count extension example](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/example-word-count/).
