# Selection Word Count

This simple VSCode extension calculates and displays the word count of a document and, when there is a selection, the word count of a selection. It displays both in the status bar.

## Requirements

This is an adaptation of the [word count extension example](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/example-word-count/).
